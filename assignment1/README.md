# IERG 5350 Assignment 1: Tabular Reinforcement Learning



**Due: 23:59, October 3 (Sunday), 2021.**




Welcome to the first official assignment of this course! The objective of the Assignment 1 is to:

1. let you get familiar with the basic framework of reinforcement learning (RL), such as the agent-environment interaction loops. 

2. let you implement the basic tabular RL algorithms to solve a toy problem.

We left sufficient information in the jupyter notebook so please walk through the file: `assignment1.ipynb`.



### Dependencies

This assignment requires the following dependencies:

1. `gym`
2. `numpy`
3. `scipy`

You can install all of them through:

```
pip install gym numpy scipy
```

After installation, remember to restart the jupyter notebook kernel by clicking `kernel/restart` 
at top bar and rerun the cells.

### Finish the assignment

Open a shell and `cd` to current directory `ierg5350-assignment-2021/assignment1` . 

Start a jupyter notebook server via `jupyter notebook`. 

Open your browser and then open the `assignment1.ipynb`. 

**We left many `[TODO]` in the file. Following the instructions in the notebook and finish all `[TODO]`.** 

Make sure your code can be run without bugs. We will run the codes by `Restart & Run All` so make sure nothing stop the running.




### Submit the assignment

Following the procedure to submit your work:

1. Before submitting, remember to fill your name and student ID into the table at the top of the file.
2. Run your codes in sequential manner, that is, run it by `Restart & Run All`. Remember to keep everything (printed message) intact.
3. Generate the **PDF file** via `File / Download As / pdf ` to the assignment directory.
4. Zip the assignment directory to a **ZIP file**.
5. Submit the **PDF file** and the **ZIP file** to blackboard.






If you find anything confusing, feel free to open an issue at Github. We will response to you as soon as possible.
