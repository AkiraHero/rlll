**Due: 11:59 pm, October 31, 2021**

Welcome to the third assignment of this course! The objective of the Assignment 3 is to 

1. Implement several approximation techniques.
2. Understand the optimization process of n-step TD control.
3. Implement a simple neural network by Numpy.
4. Get familiar with Pytorch.



You need to prepare such packages:

1. Python 3
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Gym
4. gym[atari], install via `pip install 'gym[atari]'`
5. Numpy
6. Pytorch, please refer to official website https://pytorch.org for installation guide

If you find anything confusing, feel free to open an issue at Github. We will response to you as soon as possible. 
If you get stuck by some strange errors, check the Github repo since it may be fixed by our latest commits.
